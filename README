Cause I keep forgetting how to do thisâ€¦

 docker run -ti --rm r-base

will run in interactive mode the image called r-base

In order to build an image::

    docker build -t nellev/rbase .

In order to push the image onto dockerhub

    docker push nellev/rbase

If you are running out of space:

    docker container prune
    docker image prune
